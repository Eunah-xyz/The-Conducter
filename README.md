## About The Project

Become a maestro and conduct the music that you want in Spotify!!

Use your index finger (or just your whole hand) to control which device is playing the song or the volume

## Installation

1. You need a premium Spotify account - but you can get a free 3 months trial!
2. Enter your command promt
3. Create a virtual environment and activate it
4. Make sure that your python version is lower or equal then 3.10
5. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. You need to set up spotify keys as a json file and place it in the "gitignore" folder as "spotify_keys.json"
7. Run 'jupyter notebook' to open the project in jupyter



## Running your web application

1. Open "The Conducter" file
2. Run the code line by line
3. In line 3 check if you are running the right python 3.10
4. When the app opens the Spotify website on your browser, also open up Spotify on your mobile browser. Make sure you log in to both browser using the same account with the one you produced your "spotify_keys.json"
5. Choose a music or a playlist that you want to conduct and play it!
6. As you run the last line, the webcam will pop up !!
7. Control which device playing by moving your hand left & right. Control the volume by moving your hand up & down. 
   * The volume toggle only works on the web browser
   * Use just ONE hand. More than one does not work (sadly, but maybe next time)
